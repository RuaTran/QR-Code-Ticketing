# QR-Code Ticketing Scripts and Frontend
This is the sample code for the frontend of a QR Code Ticketing project worked on to allow people to easily create, send, and authorize tickets for any purpose for which that is necessary.
Not included for privacy reasons but will be once generalized are the automated emailing script, payment verification script.

This code currently live and in use on [this site](https://www.jsaucsc.org/) at the moment, and will be have several updates made to it as more events come up.

This version currently directly queries a SQL database as it is for simple personal use, but a version with higher level security (i.e.- speaking to a server) is available, but this is just a sample.

## To-do
- Include scripts for automated emailing
- Improve user experience by making an executable that allows for all functionality in one place

## Contact
I'm open to any questions that people may have about this project, so please feel free to send a message to MunfMunf#9104 if you're looking at the code in an attempt to modify it or use bits of it to make your own project.
